TVNL for Android TV
=========================

This is the source code of the ['TVNL' Android TV application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.se_bastiaan.tvnl).

It's been some time since I built the [NPO application for Windows Phone](https://github.com/se-bastiaan/TVNL-WindowsPhone). Now that I wanted to build something using Android's [Leanback library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#v17-leanback) I decided that an Android TV application had some potential.

~The application is not completely done yet, I still need to finish some things. But those are things for the future.~
The future never came. If I ever work on this again then it'll be a full rewrite since the API's changed. 

This repo's still here because it's cool to keep old things. If my future me ever reads this:
This was awesome. You expected 3 installs, you got 5000. No marketing anywhere. The internet is cool.
